p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)


Date 06-sept-2023
Python Inheritance
________________________________________
Dove into Python inheritance today, a core concept in object-oriented programming that facilitates code reusability and hierarchy. Understanding how classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes was an eye-opener. Inheritance allows for the creation of new classes (derived or child classes) that inherit properties from existing classes (base or parent classes), enabling the extension and specialization of functionality. Exploring inheritance hierarchies and the use of methods like super() for accessing parent class functionalities deepened my comprehension. Recognizing the flexibility it offers in creating modular and scalable code structures was quite fascinating. Tomorrow, I plan to explore more complex inheritance patterns and delve into practical applications of inheritance in real-world scenarios.
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
• Create a Parent Class
    class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
      self.firstname = fname
      self.lastname = lname

   def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

   x = Person("John", "Doe")
   x.printname()
• Create a Child Class and add methods
   class Student (Person):
   def __init__ (self, fname, lname, year):
   super().__init__(fname, lname)
   self.graduationyear = year

   def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)

Exception Handling : When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message. These exceptions can be handled using the try statement. 
In this example, the try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined:
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")
In this example, the try block does not generate any error:
try:
  print("Hello")
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")

________________________________________
Today was dedicated to rectifying issues within the dataset for analysis. Commencing the day with a thorough evaluation of the dataset's anomalies—ranging from mismatched data types to inconsistent structurere formulated a strategy for data cleaning and transformation. Through the day, I diligently employed Pandas functionalities to rectify discrepancies, handle missing values, convert data types, and standardize formatting.Cells with data of wrong format can make it difficult, or even impossible, to analyse data. To fix it, you have two options: remove the rows, or convert all cells in the columns into the same format.
In our Data Frame, we have two cells with the wrong format. Check out row 22 and 26, the 'Date' column should be a string that represents a date:

  21        60   '2020/12/21'    108       131     364.2
  22        45    NaN               100       119     282.0
  23        60   '2020/12/23'    130       101     300.0

Cleaning Wrong Data
________________________________________
Fixing wrong data : "Wrong data" does not have to be "empty cells" or "wrong format", it can just be wrong, like if someone registered "199" instead of "1.99". If you take a look at our data set, you can see that in row 7, the duration is 450, but for all the other rows the duration is between 30 and 60. 
  5         60  '2020/12/06'    102       127     300.0
  6         60  '2020/12/07'    110       136     374.0
  7        450  '2020/12/08'    104       134     253.3
  8         30  '2020/12/09'    109       133     195.1
• Replacing Values ,Set "Duration" = 45 in row 7:
 df.loc[7, 'Duration'] = 45

• Removing Rows, Another way of handling wrong data is to remove the rows that contains      wrong data.
 for x in df.index:
   if df.loc[x, "Duration"] > 120:
     df.drop(x, inplace = True)
